# **Machine Learning Projects**



**This was developed as part of the Machine Learning 1 course at the Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague (FIT ÄŒVUT).**

This repository contains two projects:

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
*Description:*

In this project, we analyze the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques. The models used include:

- Decision Trees

- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

*Key Steps:*

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature encoding, normalization).
Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation using accuracy, F1-score and AUC.

## 2. Lifespan Prediction by Country
*Description:*

This project explores regression models to predict the average lifespan of a country's population based on various socio-economic and health-related features. Models used include:

- Ridge Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- AdaBoost

*Key Steps:*

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, feature selection).
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify correlations.
Model training and evaluation using metrics such as MAE, RMSE.
